<h1>Welcome to the Style Guide</h1>

A record of patterns and components will be maintained here as they are
added to the styleguide, grouped by version number. This should help us
see at a glance what is new or what has been altered over time.

### Pattern State

For some projects, it's important to have a simple way of determining whether or not a pattern is ready to be folded into a production site. Because of this, all patterns will have the following state indicators in place.

<span class="kss-state documented development">In Development</span>

Pattern is being actively worked on and should not be used outside of the styleguide in its current state.

<span class="kss-state documented review">In Review</span>

Pattern is complete with regards to active work, but needs review from relevant parties.

<span class="kss-state documented ready">Production Ready</span>

Pattern has been vetted and tested and is ready for use on a production site.
