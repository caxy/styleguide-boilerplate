# KSS Assets

This folder is solely for assets related to the styleguide and its own
behaviors (eg. color swatch creation, markup example rendering). Any js,
img, or other files related to your project should be added to the 
styleguide in a separate folder, or linked to in another way.

Links to outside files can be added to the appropriate object in the
`config/kss-config.json` file.
