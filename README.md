# KSS Styleguide with Caxy's Zaba Theme Builder

Caxy's boilerplate styleguide setup. Uses KSS-node to render, and Caxy's
Zaba theme to build.

[KSS Documentation](http://warpspire.com/kss/)

This styleguide boilerplate has its assets completely removed from the 
project assets. This does two things:
 
-   Streamlines implementation of the CSS assets themselves, since they
    aren't tangled up with the styleguide assets
-   Allows the styleguide to represent the project CSS with 100%
    accuracy, without styleguide CSS being misconstrued for project CSS.
